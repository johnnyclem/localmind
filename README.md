## 🚀 Vision

Built for those who value privacy and performance, LocalMind connects directly to your local inference servers like **LM Studio** or **Ollama**, as well as cloud providers like **OpenRouter**. No middleware, no tracking, and no hidden subscriptions. Just you and your models.

## ✨ Key Features

- 📲 **On-Device AI Support (Android)**: Private, fast, and offline. Run powerful AI models directly on your device with no internet required.
- 📂 **Model Manager**: Download and manage curated models like Qwen 3 (0.6B), DeepSeek R1, and Gemma 4 directly within the app.
- 🖥️ **Multi-Server Connection**: Seamlessly connect to LM Studio, Ollama, or OpenRouter with real-time health monitoring.
- 💬 **Premium Chat Experience**: A polished, ChatGPT/Claude-inspired interface with:
  - **Streaming Responses**: Real-time SSE support for instant feedback.
  - **Markdown Rendering**: Beautiful rendering of text and code with syntax highlighting.
  - **Message Actions**: Copy, retry, or delete individual messages with a long-press menu.
- 🎨 **Revamped Sidebar**: A cleaner, more intuitive, and feature-rich navigation experience.
- 🧠 **Persona Management**: Switch between specialized AI personas (Code Assistant, Math Tutor, etc.) or create your own with custom system prompts.
- 🔄 **Live Model Swapping**: Change the active model mid-conversation without losing context.
- 📦 **Conversation History**: Full-text search through your past chats, pinning important conversations, and local-only storage.
- 🎨 **Deep Customization**:
  - **Theming**: Premium dark-first design (with light mode support).
  - **Chat Parameters**: Fine-tune temperature, top_p, max tokens, and context length.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

LocalMind is built with modern, scalable technologies:

- **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (Latest Stable)
- **On-Device AI**: [LiteRT (TensorFlow Lite)](https://ai.google.dev/edge/litert) for high-performance localized inference.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn-inspired design system (`shadcn_ui`)
- **State Management**: [Riverpod](https://riverpod.dev/) for robust, testable state.
- **Local Storage**: [ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io/) (and Hive) for high-performance on-device persistence.
- **Networking**: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) for optimized REST API handling.
- **Rendering**: `flutter_markdown` + `flutter_highlight` for rich content.

## 🛡️ Privacy First

- **Zero Analytics**: We don't track how you use the app.
- **Local Storage**: Your conversations are stored only on your device, encrypted via Hive.
- **Direct Traffic**: Network requests go directly to _your_ servers. LocalMind never sees your data.
